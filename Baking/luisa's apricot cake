Luisa's Apricot Cake

Base recipe
For each egg: 50g sugar, 50g room-temperature butter, 50g flour.

1. Whisk eggs + sugar for approximately 5 minutes.
2. Add soft butter, whisk again.
3. Add flour and some baking powder (depending on how much flour you use).
4. Put in the baking form.
5. Add the washed, halved apricots into the dough. Be careful not to push them too deep into the dough.
6. Bake at 180Â°C for 30-40 minutes until golden.

Usually I do 4 eggs for a regular, 24cm diameter cake form.
This cake is great with prunes or berries too!
