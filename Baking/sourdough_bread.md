# Sourdough bread

My default sourdough bread recipe. This recipe is for one small (~400g) and one
medium (~700g) sized boule.


## Ingredients

### Levain

* 30g starter
* 30g full wheat flour
* 30g rye flour
* 60g water

### Dough

* 550g white flour
* 100g full wheat flour or rye flour 
* 500g water
* 14g salt

## Preparation

1. *Levain*: Mix starter and water in a jar, add flour. Mix until it is a
   homogenous paste. Put in a warm environment (~ 27째C), for example, your oven
   with the lights turned on. Mark the height of the levain at the beginning
   (e.g. with a rubber band).

2. *Autolyse*: After the levain is almost double the size (usually after 3-5
   hours, depends a bit on the conditions in your place), mix in a bowl all of
   the flour with 400g of warm water. Cover with a damp towel.

3. *Mixing*: When the levain is almost triple the initial size (but not yet
   collapesed), mix well with the autolysing dough and 50g of water. Cover with
   damp towel. After resting for 15 minutes, combine with the remaining 50g of
   water and the salt. Knead the dough firmly until it passes the windowpane
   test (I often use a stand mixer because I'm too lazy). Cover with damp towel
   and let rest in warm environment.

4. *Bulk fermentation*: Perform 4 to 6 stretch and folds until the dough is
    almost double the size and you can see bubbles at the top. Let the dough
    rest 30 minutes between the first 3 folds, let it rest 60 minutes between
    the last ones.
    
5. *Shaping*: Divide into two parts and preshape. Let rest for 15 minutes. Shape
    into preferred shape afterwards and pot into flourd proofing basket. It is
    important to create enough tension. This step can be challenging at first, I
    recommend to watch tutorials on youtube. Let the shaped dough rest outside
    for another 30 minutes, then put in fridge covered with something so the
    dough does not dry out (I use shower caps).

6. *Baking*: The next morning, preheat dutch oven (without lid) to 260째C. When
    temperature is reached, take loaf out of the fridge. Dust top and bottom
    with flour (I use rice flour because it keeps white color and looks very
    nice). Score the loaf with a sharp blade and put into dutch oven. It can be
    helpful to put on baking paper to make the transfer to the hot dutch oven
    easier. Bake for 20 minutes with lid on top at 260째C (the dough should
    rise). Remove lid and lower to 230째C for 25 to 35 minutes, until the bread
    is nicely brown. Let cool completely.
